Better product recommendations based on shopping behavior.
Personalized promotions based on transaction history.
For Sellers:

Detailed revenue reports by region.
Real-time insights into the best-selling products.
For System Administrators:

Scalability to handle growing data volumes.
Instant resolution of transaction issues.
# Architecture and Technology Overview
1. Data Ingestion (Apache Kafka)
Function: Collect and stream transaction data from the platform's web/app to the processing system.
Implementation Details:
Main Topics:
transactions: Stores transaction details.
users: Stores user information (ID, address, age, etc.).
products: Stores product details (ID, category, price, etc.).
Scale: Kafka is configured to handle 1 million events per day.
2. Real-Time Data Processing (Apache Flink)
Function:
Analyze total revenue by category and city.
Detect best-selling products.
Trigger alerts for low-stock products.
Implementation Details:
Flink uses Kafka Consumer to fetch data from Kafka.
Key Calculations:
Total Revenue = Quantity x Price.
Transaction statistics by Category and City.
Identify Top 5 Best-Selling Products of the day.
3. Long-Term Data Storage (Hadoop)
Function: Store historical transaction data in HDFS for deeper analysis.
Implementation Details:
HDFS Storage Paths:
javascript
Copy code
/shopsphere/transactions/
/shopsphere/users/
/shopsphere/products/
Use Spark or Hive for further analysis of stored data.
Data Flow
Transaction from Users:

When users make a purchase, the transaction data is sent from the application to Kafka.
Processing via Flink:

Flink processes data from Kafka in real time:
Calculates revenue by city and category.
Identifies best-selling products.
Storage via Hadoop:

Processed data is stored in HDFS for long-term analysis.
Outputs of ShopSphere
Real-Time Reports
Total Revenue by Region:
Example: "London: £100,000, Manchester: £50,000".
Top Best-Selling Products:
Example: "iPhone 14: 500 orders, Nike Shoes: 300 orders".
Long-Term Analysis
Historical Transaction Reports:
Monthly or yearly aggregated transactions.
Shopping Trends:
Popular products by season.


 # System Requirements
Operating System: Linux/Windows/MacOS (Linux preferred for distributed systems)
Java Version: Java 8 or higher (required for Hadoop, Kafka, and Flink)
Tools:
Apache Kafka
Apache Hadoop
Apache Flink
Zookeeper (for Kafka coordination)
# Step-by-Step Setup
# Setting Up Apache Kafka
Download and Extract Kafka:

# Download Kafka from the official website.
Extract the files and navigate to the Kafka directory.
Start Zookeeper:
Run the following command to start Zookeeper, which Kafka requires:

bash
# Copy code
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
Start Kafka Broker:
Launch the Kafka broker:

bash
# Copy code
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Create Kafka Topics:
Create topics for transactions, users, and products:

bash
# Copy code
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic users --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic products --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
B. Setting Up Apache Hadoop
Download Hadoop:

# Download Hadoop from the official website.
Extract the files and configure the core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml files to define Namenode and Datanode directories.
Start Hadoop Services:

# Format the Namenode:
bash
Copy code
hdfs namenode -format
Start Namenode and Datanode:
bash
Copy code
start-dfs.sh
Create HDFS Directories: Create directories to store processed data:

bash
# Copy code
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/shopsphere/data
# Setting Up Apache Flink
Download Flink:

Download Flink from the official website.
Extract the files and navigate to the Flink directory.
Start Flink Cluster:

bash
# Copy code
bin/start-cluster.sh
Deploy Flink Job:

# Package your Flink job (e.g., as a .jar file).
Deploy it to the Flink cluster:
bash
# Copy code
bin/flink run -c org.shopsphere.JobName /path/to/your-job.jar
# How to Run ShopSphere
Step 1: Start All Services
Start Zookeeper and Kafka:
bash
# Copy code
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Start Hadoop (Namenode and Datanodes):
bash
# Copy code
start-dfs.sh
Start Flink Cluster:
bash
# Copy code
bin/start-cluster.sh
# Data Ingestion
Simulate Data:
Use Kafka producer to send data to the transactions topic:
bash
# Copy code
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Example input:
arduino
# Copy code
1,1001,2001,"Laptop","Electronics",2,1500.00,3000.00,2024-12-30 14:30:00,"London"
# Data Processing
Deploy your Flink job to consume Kafka data, process it, and output results to HDFS:
Ingest data from the transactions topic.
Calculate metrics (e.g., total revenue per city or category).
Write processed data to HDFS.
Step 4: Data Storage
View the processed data stored in HDFS:
bash
# Copy code
hdfs dfs -ls /user/shopsphere/data
hdfs dfs -cat /user/shopsphere/data/processed-output.csv
# Monitoring
Kafka: Use Kafka tools to monitor topics:
bash
# Copy code
bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Flink: Access the Flink web dashboard at http://localhost:8081 to monitor jobs.
Hadoop: Access the Namenode web UI at http://localhost:50070.
# Conclusion
This setup processes e-commerce transaction data in real-time using Kafka and Flink while storing insights in Hadoop for long-term analytics.
The modular design allows future integration with machine learning and advanced visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
